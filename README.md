# LeRobot Team Workspace

This repo tracks our **project codes** in `scripts/`.  
The upstream `lerobot/` codebase is *not* tracked here.

## Structure
- `scripts/` — project utilities, experiments, and notebooks
- `lerobot/` — local clone of upstream repo (ignored)

## Getting Started
```bash
# (example) create env
conda create -n lerobot python=3.10 -y
conda activate lerobot
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
